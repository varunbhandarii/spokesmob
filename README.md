# Spokesmob

Your chat, one voice.

Spokesmob turns Twitch chat into one spoken voice with visible agreement and an OBS browser-source overlay.

## Development

Requires Node.js 24.15 or newer and npm. Storage uses Node's built-in SQLite.

```powershell
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run lint
```

The workspace contains the server, overlay, control page, shared logic, development tools, and evaluation runner. Startup commands are still under development.

Run `npm run setup` to sign in to Twitch. Open the activation URL printed by the command, enter its human activation code, and approve the requested permissions. Running setup again reuses valid authorization. The broadcaster account is recommended; moderator authorization is unverified.

Tokens are saved atomically outside the repository: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Spokesmob\tokens.json` on Windows, or `~/.config/spokesmob/tokens.json` elsewhere. To sign out, stop the application and delete that file (or the file selected by `TOKEN_FILE`). Keep the file private.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials locally. Keep credentials out of source control.
